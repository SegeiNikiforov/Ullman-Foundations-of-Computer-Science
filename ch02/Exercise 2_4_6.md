Prove the statement by complete induction on n, for n > 0

The statement S(n): If the expression E has binary operators then E must have an odd length.

1) From Exercise 2.4.3 we have proved that if E has n operator occurrences, then E has n + 1 operands

2) The number of operators and operands equal to n + n + 1 = 2n + 1. Also we know the odd number has formula 2n + 1

3) We know that in the valid expression the number of parenthesis is even. The formula of even number is 2n

4) We know the sum of odd and even numbers is odd. So the expression (2n + 1) + 2n is odd
