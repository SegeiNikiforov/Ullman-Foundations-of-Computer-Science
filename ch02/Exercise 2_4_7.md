Let us prove by induction on n the following statement for all negative n.

STATEMENT S(n): There are integers a and b (positive, negative, or 0) such that n = 2a + 3b.

Basis: 
* For n = 0; 2(0) + 3(0) = 0;
* For n = -1; 2(1) + 3(-1) = -1;

Let us prove by induction on n the statement for all negative n. We assume that k+1 can be presented as 2a + 3b. We suppose that if k+1 can be written as 2a + 2b then k-1 can also be written as 2a + 2b. Let's prove this.

k-1 = (k + 1) - 2;

k-1 = (2a + 3b) - 2;

k-1 = 2(a - 1) + 3b;

(a - 1) and b are integers. So k-1 can be presented as 2a + 3b. We have proved by complete induction that if the statement S(k+1) is true then the statement S(k-1) is also true.
