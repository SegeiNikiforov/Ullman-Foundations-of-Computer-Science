Original expression: (u + v) + ((w + (x + y)) + z)

We use associative law: u + (v + ((w + (x + y)) + z))

We use associative law: u + (v + (w + (x + y) + z))

We use associative law: u + (v + (w + (x + (y + z))))

With help of associative law and commutative law we can get any combination of operands. Assumption is associative and commutative operators are used.
